# MalConv-Deep-learning-for-PE-malware-classification

This repository hosts the Bahareh Arghavani Midterm Report, detailing a comprehensive exploration into malware classification using the MalConv model with the EMBER-2017 v2 dataset. The project underscores the criticality of data preprocessing and normalization, leveraging MinMaxScaler to ensure data uniformity, crucial for deep learning model training. By meticulously avoiding unnecessary reshaping, our preprocessing strategy is finely tuned for the MalConv model, which thrives on direct PE file feature extraction for malware detection. The model architecture, built on PyTorch, incorporates embedding and convolutional layers, optimized through an innovative gating mechanism and global max pooling to focus on salient malware indicators. Training procedures, rooted in rigorous dataset handling and partitioning, utilize the Adam optimizer and BCE loss, with a keen eye on preventing overfitting through continuous monitoring. Evaluation showcases the model's robustness in generalization, using accuracy, precision, and recall as metrics. Furthermore, the project extends into deployment, with a detailed setup in Amazon SageMaker, ensuring seamless model inference in the cloud. This work not only demonstrates a state-of-the-art approach to malware detection but also serves as a blueprint for deploying sophisticated AI models in real-world applications."
